# Context Configuration for Claude Code Subagent
#
# This file defines which files/directories should be automatically injected
# into the subagent's prompt when using the Task tool.
#
# Each line is a JSON object with the following fields:
# - file: Path to file or directory (relative to repo root)
# - type: "file" or "directory" (default: "file")
# - pattern: Glob pattern for directory type (default: "*")
# - reason: Description of why this context is needed
#
# Examples:

# Directory injection with pattern
{"file": "docs/迭代/Hook自动注入/stories/", "type": "directory", "pattern": "*.md", "reason": "故事文件，包含任务细节"}
